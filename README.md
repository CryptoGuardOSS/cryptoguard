# CryptoGuard: Source Code

An program analysis tool to find cryptographic misuse in Java and Android.

### Prerequisites to use CryptoGuard on Source code:

1. Download and Install JDK 7.
2. Set `JAVA7_HOME` environment variable.
3. Download and Install Gradle.

### Prerequisites to use CryptoGuard on Jar:

1. Download and Install JDK (version >= 7).
2. Set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
3. Download and Install Gradle.

### Prerequisites to use CryptoGuard on Apk:

1. Download and Install JDK (version >= 7).
2. Set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
3. Download and Install Android SDK
4. Set `ANDROID_SDK_HOME`
5. Download and Install Gradle.

### Build CryptoGuard
1. Run `cd /path/to/cryptoguard`
2. Run `gradle clean build`

### Run CryptoGuard to analyze source code:

You need to run CryptoGuard on JDK 7 to analyze source codes. If the project does not have any external dependencies then run,
     
`cd /path/to/cryptoguard &&  /usr/local/jdk1.7.0_80/bin/java -jar main/build/libs/main.jar "source" "/path/to/project/root" "" 1`

If the project have external dependencies then first gather the dependencies under a folder that is relative to the project root (e.g., “build/dependencies”), then run

`cd /path/to/cryptoguard && /usr/local/jdk1.7.0_80/bin/java -jar main/build/libs/main.jar "source" "/path/to/project/root" "build/dependencies" 1`

Note that if you have multiple subprojects with external dependencies, then you have to gather all the corresponding subproject dependencies under a path that is relative to each of the subprojects.

### Run CryptoGuard to analyze Jar:

`cd /path/to/cryptoguard && java -jar main/build/libs/main.jar "jar" "/path/to/jar/my-jar.jar" "" 1`

### Run CryptoGuard to analyze Apk:

`cd /path/to/cryptoguard && java -jar main/build/libs/main.jar "apk" "/path/to/apk/my-apk.apk" "" 1`
