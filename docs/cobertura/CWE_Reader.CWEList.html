It should be noted that, despite common perceptions, the use of a good salt with a hash does not sufficiently increase the effort for an attacker who is targeting an individual password, or who has a large amount of computing resources available, such as with cloud-based services or specialized, inexpensive hardware. Offline password cracking can still be effective if the hash function is not expensive to compute; many cryptographic functions are designed to be efficient and can be vulnerable to attacks using massive computing resources, even if the hash is cryptographically strong. The use of a salt only slightly increases the computing requirements for an attacker compared to other strategies such as adaptive hash functions. See CWE-916 for more details.\n::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:916:VIEW ID:699:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:916:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::\n::In cryptography, salt refers to some random addition of data to an input before hashing to make dictionary attacks more difficult.::\n:::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:::\n::SCOPE:Access Control:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:Access Control Bypass Protection Mechanism Gain Privileges or Assume Identity If an attacker can gain access to the hashes, then the lack of a salt makes it easier to conduct brute force attacks using techniques such as rainbow tables.::\n::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Bytecode Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysis Binary Weakness Analysis - including disassembler + source code weakness analysis::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Binary / Bytecode disassembler - then use manual analysis for vulnerabilities &amp; anomalies::METHOD:Manual Static Analysis - Source Code:EFFECTIVENESS:High:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Focused Manual Spotcheck - Focused manual analysis of source Manual Source Code Review (not inspections)::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis - Source Code:EFFECTIVENESS:High:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Source code Weakness Analyzer Context-configured Source Code Weakness Analyzer::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR Partial:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Configuration Checker::METHOD:Architecture or Design Review:EFFECTIVENESS:High:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful: Highly cost effective: Formal Methods / Correct-By-Construction Cost effective for partial coverage: Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design, source code, etc.)::\n::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS:High:DESCRIPTION:Use an adaptive hash function that can be configured to change the amount of computational effort needed to compute the hash, such as the number of iterations (stretching) or the amount of memory required. Some hash functions perform salting automatically. These functions can significantly increase the overhead for a brute force attack compared to intentionally-fast functions such as MD5. For example, rainbow table attacks can become infeasible due to the high computing overhead. Finally, since computing power gets faster and cheaper over time, the technique can be reconfigured to increase the workload without forcing an entire replacement of the algorithm in use. Some hash functions that have one or more of these desired properties include bcrypt [REF-291], scrypt [REF-292], and PBKDF2 [REF-293]. While there is active debate about which of these is the most effective, they are all stronger than using salts with hash functions with very little computing overhead. Note that using these functions can have an impact on performance, so they require special consideration to avoid denial-of-service attacks. However, their configurability provides finer control over how much CPU and memory is used, so it could be adjusted to suit the environment's needs.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS:Limited:DESCRIPTION:If a technique that requires extra computational effort can not be implemented, then for each password that is processed, generate a new random salt using a strong random number generator with unpredictable seeds. Add the salt to the plaintext password before hashing it. When storing the hash, also store the salt. Do not use the same salt for every password.::PHASE:Implementation Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:When using industry-approved techniques, use them correctly. Don't cut corners by skipping resource-intensive steps (CWE-325). These steps are often essential for preventing common attacks.::\n::REFERENCE:CVE-2008-1526:DESCRIPTION:Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.:LINK:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1526REFERENCE:CVE-2006-1058:DESCRIPTION:Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.:LINK:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1058\n"</span>));</pre></td></tr>

Use an accept known good input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, boat may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as red or blue. Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.

Furthermore, the HTTP specification requires that GET requests (and other requests) should not have side effects. Believing that it will be enough to prevent unintended resource alterations, an application may disallow the HTTP requests to perform DELETE, PUT and POST operations on the resource representation. However, there is nothing in the HTTP protocol itself that actually prevents the HTTP GET method from performing more than just query of the data. Developers can easily code programs that accept a HTTP GET request that do in fact create, update or delete data on the server. For instance, it is a common practice with REST based Web Services to have HTTP GET requests modifying resources on the server side. However, whenever that happens, the access control needs to be properly enforced in the application.

It should be noted that, despite common perceptions, the use of a good salt with a hash does not sufficiently increase the effort for an attacker who is targeting an individual password, or who has a large amount of computing resources available, such as with cloud-based services or specialized, inexpensive hardware. Offline password cracking can still be effective if the hash function is not expensive to compute; many cryptographic functions are designed to be efficient and can be vulnerable to attacks using massive computing resources, even if the hash is cryptographically strong. The use of a salt only slightly increases the computing requirements for an attacker compared to other strategies such as adaptive hash functions.

Some hash functions perform salting automatically. These functions can significantly increase the overhead for a brute force attack compared to intentionally-fast functions such as MD5. For example, rainbow table attacks can become infeasible due to the high computing overhead. Finally, since computing power gets faster and cheaper over time, the technique can be reconfigured to increase the workload without forcing an entire replacement of the algorithm in use. Some hash functions that have one or more of these desired properties include bcrypt [REF-291], scrypt [REF-292], and PBKDF2 [REF-293]. While there is active debate about which of these is the most effective, they are all stronger than using salts with hash functions with very little computing overhead. Note that using these functions can have an impact on performance, so they require special consideration to avoid denial-of-service attacks. However, their configurability provides finer control over how much CPU and memory is used, so it could be adjusted to suit the environment's needs.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS:Limited:DESCRIPTION:If a technique that requires extra computational effort can not be implemented, then for each password that is processed, generate a new random salt using a strong random number generator with unpredictable seeds.

While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.\n::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:330:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:330:VIEW ID:699:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:330:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::\n:::LANGUAGE CLASS:Language-Independent:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::\n:::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION::::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:::\n::SCOPE:Access Control:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:Access Control Bypass Protection Mechanism If a PRNG is used for authentication and authorization, such as a session ID or a seed for generating a cryptographic key, then an attacker may be able to easily guess the ID or cryptographic key and gain access to restricted functionality.::\n::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use functions or hardware which use a hardware-based random number generation for all crypto.

If the certificate's host-specific data is not properly checked - such as the Common Name (CN) in the Subject or the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension of an X.509 certificate - it may be possible for a redirection or spoofing attack to allow a malicious host with a valid certificate to provide data, impersonating a trusted host. In order to ensure data integrity, the certificate must be valid and it must pertain to the site that is being accessed. Even if the software attempts to check the hostname, it is still possible to incorrectly check the hostname. For example, attackers could create a certificate with a name that begins with a trusted name followed by a NUL byte, which could cause some string-based comparisons to only examine the portion that contains the trusted name. This weakness can occur even when the software uses Certificate Pinning, if the software does not verify the hostname at the time a certificate is pinned.\n::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:295:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:295:VIEW ID:699:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:295:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:923:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::\n:::LANGUAGE CLASS:Language-Independent:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::PARADIGN NAME:Mobile:PARADIGN PREVALENCE:Undetermined::\n:::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION::::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:::\n::SCOPE:Access Control:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:Access Control Gain Privileges or Assume Identity The data read from the system vouched for by the certificate may not be from the expected system.::SCOPE:Authentication:SCOPE:Other:TECHNICAL IMPACT:Other:NOTE:Authentication Other Other Trust afforded to the system in question - based on the malicious certificate - may allow for spoofing or redirection attacks.::\n::METHOD:Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation:EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Set up an untrusted endpoint (e.g. a server) with which the software will connect.
